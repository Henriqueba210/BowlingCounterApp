# BowlingCounterApp

> The objective of this repository is to create an app that can count the number of points in a bowling game.

My initial idea on how to implement the counting logic is through two classes:

- A Frame class that handles the logic of each frame internally
- A Counter class that contains a list with 10 frames that will handle the data input and telling the frame if it should add a bonus to its score or whether it should switch its internal logic to account for it being the last frame.
